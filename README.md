# Manchester Metro Route Planner ðŸš‡

A Java application that calculates routes on a Manchester-style metro/tram network.

The app supports two different routing strategies:
1. Shortest path (fewest stops or lowest total weight) using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
2. Least changes (minimise line/interchange changes) using BFS / layered search

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) design and graph algorithms.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… OOP design â€“ stations, connections, and lines are modelled as objects
- âœ… Two route modes:
  - Shortest Path â†’ Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
  - Least Changes â†’ BFS / modified search
- âœ… Input validation for unknown stations
- âœ… Text-based route output (step-by-step)
- âœ… Easily extendable to new stations or lines
- âœ… Useful for teaching or demonstration purposes

## ðŸ§  How it works

- The metro network is represented as a graph:
  - Nodes = stations
  - Edges = connections (with optional weights such as time)
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm finds the minimum-cost path between two stations
- BFS finds a path that minimises transfers (even if slightly longer)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 (or Java 11+)
- A terminal or IDE such as IntelliJ or VS Code

### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/E-RAFFERTY/metro-route-planner.git
cd metro-route-planner

### Compile
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")

### Run
java -cp out ui.Main

---

## ðŸ§® Algorithms

### Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
- Treats the metro as a weighted graph
- Each edge has a cost (1 for stops, or travel time)
- Guarantees the optimal path for non-negative weights

### BFS (Least-Changes)
- Treats the network as an unweighted graph
- Explores by number of hops
- Prefers staying on the same line
- Good for minimising transfers

## ðŸ§± Object-Oriented Design

Station â†’ stores name, zone, and neighbours  
Connection â†’ represents links between stations  
MetroNetwork â†’ manages all stations and connections  
RouteFinder â†’ interface for route-finding algorithms  
DijkstraRouteFinder and BfsRouteFinder implement RouteFinder

This structure allows adding new algorithms, constraints, or GUIs easily.
